# Setup

Install latest macOS version.

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Clone this repo. It's fine to use its public (non-authenticated) HTTPS URL until I have to make changes to it.

```bash
$ git submodule update --init
$ setup/all # Or run each of its steps manually
# Review output for errors and manual steps
```

Update these files as needed:

```bash
$ vi -o ~/.bashrc home-examples/.bashrc
$ vi -o ~/.ssh/config home-examples/.ssh/config
```

## Manual steps

**iTerm**

Enable "Load preferences from a custom folder" and point to `iterm` directory.
