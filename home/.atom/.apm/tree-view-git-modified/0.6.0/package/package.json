Opens all git modified files at once with a simple command.\n\nThis plugin was developed by using code samples from the following atom plugins:\n- tree-view-open-files\n- open-git-modified-files\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n'ctrl-alt-o': 'tree-view-git-modified:toggle' // Shows or hides panel\n'ctrl-cmd-o': 'tree-view-git-modified:openAll' // Open all git modified files\n```\n\n![A screenshot of your package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjaviervega/tree-view-git-modified/master/screenshots/tree-view-git-modified.png)\n\n## Issues\n\n- This package doesn't work well when the package tree-view-git-projects is installed.\n- Known bug, if a project folder is removed from the tree and then added again in the same session the list of modified files will not be refresh until Atom is restarted (looks like a bug on Atom related to adding a project folder after it is removed).\n\n## TODO\n\n- Include option to customize background color of selected items on tree-view.\n- Include icons to show git statuses and icons to quickly add/remove from git index.\n- Review why tree-view-git-projects breaks this package and try to make them compatible.\n- Add additional test cases.\n\n## License MIT.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rjaviervega/tree-view-git-modified/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/rjaviervega/tree-view-git-modified#readme","_id":"tree-view-git-modified@0.6.0","_shasum":"1d3cdb719e35621c1829880d98b9e9b093219722","_resolved":"file:../d-115114-76768-1uysvpm/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115114-76768-1uysvpm/package.tgz"}
