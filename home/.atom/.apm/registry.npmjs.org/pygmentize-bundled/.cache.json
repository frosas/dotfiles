Pygmentize (Bundled)\n\n**Python's Pygments code formatter, for Node.js, distributed with Pygments**\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/pygmentize-bundled.png?downloads=true&stars=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/pygmentize-bundled/) [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/pygmentize-bundled.png?months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/pygmentize-bundled/)\n\nCan be used as either a *String-in, Buffer-out*, or as a Duplex stream.\n\nCompatible with both Python v2 and v3.\n\n**Note**: this library makes use of a child process which calls Python to invoke Pygments. This can cause performance problems where a large number of code blocks are being separately formatted. Consider using **[pygmentize-bundled-cached](https://github.com/rvagg/pygmentize-bundled-cached)**, an API-compatible wrapper for this library that keeps an on-disk cache of formatted code samples which will result in significantly faster formats when repeatedly formatting the same blocks of code.\n\n## API\n\n**pygmentize(options, code, callback)**\n\nPygmentize a given `code` string and return it as a Buffer to the `callback` Function.\n\n* `options` contains options to be passed to Pygments (see [Options](#options)).\n* `code` is a String to be formatted.\n* `callback` is a Function, called when complete. The first argument will be an `error` object/string if there was a problem and the second argument will be a Buffer containing your formatted code.\n\n**pygmentize(options)**\n\nWhen you only supply the `options` argument, it will return a Duplex stream that you can pipe to and from to format your code.\n\n* `options` contains options to be passed to Pygments (see [Options](#options)).\n\n## Options\n\nLanguage/lexer, formatter, and their options are currently supported. Filters are not supported yet.\n\n* `lang`: source language/lexer name - `String`\n* `format`: output formatter name - `String`\n* `python`: the full path to the `python` command on the current system, defaults to `'python'` - `String`\n* `options`: lexer and formatter options, each key/value pair is passed through to `pygmentize` with `-P` - `Object`\n\n## Examples\n\nThe string interface is very simple:\n\n```js\nvar pygmentize = require('pygmentize-bundled')\n\npygmentize({ lang: 'js', format: 'html' }, 'var a = \"b\";', function (err, result) {\n  console.log(result.toString())\n})\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre>\n  <span class=\"kd\">var</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">a</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"s2\">&quot;b&quot;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</pre></div>\n```\n\nExample with extra options:\n\n```js\nvar pygmentize = require('pygmentize-bundled')\n\npygmentize({ lang: 'php', format: 'html', options: { startinline: 1 } }, 'var a = true;', function (err, result) {\n  console.log(result.toString())\n})\n```\n\nA duplex streaming API is also available. Simply omit the `code` and `callback` arguments:\n\n```js\nvar pygmentize = require('pygmentize-bundled')\n\nprocess.stdin\n  .pipe(pygmentize({ lang: 'js', format: 'html' }))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nRefer to the [Pygments documentation](http://pygments.org/docs/). For supported languages, see the list of [lexers](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/), for supported formatted, see the list of [formatters](http://pygments.org/docs/formatters/).\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg)\n* [Cyril Rohr](https://github.com/crohr)\n* [Ahmed Fasih](https://github.com/fasiha)\n* [Scott Walkinshaw](https://github.com/swalkinshaw)\n* [Chris Wren](https://github.com/ChrisWren)\n\n## Licence & copyright\n\nPygments (Bundled) is Copyright (c) 2012 Rod Vagg <@rvagg> and licenced under the MIT licence.
