As soon as you begin to scroll, the minimap appears and you can interact with it normally.\n\nWritten by @JayKuri - If you like it, say Hi!\n\nForked and updated by @ansballard\n\nBy default the minimap will be hidden when not scrolling, and will slide out when scrolling.  You can, however, tweak the appearance. When you are scrolling, the minimap will have a class _scrolling_ added to it. You can therefore override the default by adding an entry to your personal `styles.less` file.\n\nFor example, if you don't like the semi-transparent background, you can override it in your theme:\n\n```less\natom-text-editor-minimap {\n  // give us a nice dark-blue background\n  background: #000040;\n}\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ansballard/minimap-autohider/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ansballard/minimap-autohider#readme","_id":"minimap-autohider@1.3.0","_shasum":"c6207aaf39ca73a30cce774b79443adf6076318a","_resolved":"file:../d-117113-11470-yovnyu/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117113-11470-yovnyu/package.tgz"}
