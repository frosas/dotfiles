  "readme": "# atomatigit\n\nReal git integration for the Atom text editor.\n\nAtomatigit allows you to see diffs, stage chunks, make commits, push, fetch,\nchange branches, delete branches, discard changes... and if there's any function\nyou're missing, you can also execute raw git commands.\n\nAtomatigit is designed to be used using ultra-fast keyboard shortcuts. Press\n`cmd-alt-g` to show the atomatigit pane on the right. From there, you can\nright-click on a file, branch, or commit to see your options, and to get a\nfriendly reminder of the keyboard shortcuts. Once you know the shortcuts, you\ncan navigate through 100% of atomatigit's functions without a mouse.\n\nAtomatigit is inspired by the\n[magit](http://magit.github.io/index.html) emacs package.\n\n![screenshot: file list](http://i.imgur.com/rRk5sSy.png)\n![screenshot: dark theme; branch list; context menu](http://i.imgur.com/axszNyW.png)\n\n## Making changes and stagin files\n\nPress `cmd-alt-g` to show the atomatigit pane on the right.\n\nAs soon as you save a file, it will show up in the list of unstaged changes.\nNavigate to it using arrow keys, i/k, or by clicking on it. Hit tab to see the\ndiff, and use `shift-s` to stage it.\n\n## Committing\n\nOnce you've staged some files, initiate a commit by hitting `c`. A new buffer\nwill open for you to enter a commit message. When you're done describing your\nchanges, `cmd-alt-c` will complete the commit.\n\n## Other Key bindings\n\nThere are many, but don't worry: if you ever forget these, Atomatigit has\nright-click menus to help remind you. Here's the complete list:\n\n- `cmd-alt-g` to open/focus/close atomatigit\n- `escape` to close\n- `up` (or `i`) and `down` (or `k`) to navigate between items\n- `c` to commit\n- `cmd-alt-c` from a commit buffer to complete a commit\n- `shift-P` to push to origin\n- `b` to view branches\n- `s` to view the staging area\n- `l` to view the commit log\n- `:` to execute a custom git command\n- `r` to refresh\n- `shift-p` to push the current branch to origin\n- `f` to fetch\n\nStaging View\n- `enter` to open a selected file\n- `tab` to see an unstaged diff\n- `shift-s` to stage a file\n- `u` to unstage a file\n- `z` to stash\n- `shift-Z` to unstash\n- `backspace` to kill a diff, or delete an untracked file\n\nBranch View\n- `enter` to checkout the selected branch\n- `c` to create a new branch\n- `backspace` to delete a branch\n\nCommit Log\n- `enter` to soft reset to a selected commit\n- `shift-enter` to hard reset\n\n## Current status\n\nAtomatigit is usable, but still in active development. Feel free to make feature requests.\n\n## Missing features (coming soon)\n\nYou cannot merge, ammend, or rebase through the UI (though you can perform the commands using `atomatigit:git-command`).\n\nMoved and deleted files have bad interactions (in terms of toggle-diff, etc).\n\nThe method for staging individual patches isn't the best interface.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\n`apm develop atomatigit`\n\nWill clone the repo for you.\n\nThe code should be quite clear. If you add new files, don't forget to add them\nto the correct `index.coffee` so they can be required from other directories.\n\nPull requests that break specs won't be merged, so be sure to run `apm test`\nbefore you PR.\n\nPull requests that spec all their new public methods will get more attention\nthan those that don't :)\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [jonathanwiesel](https://github.com/jonathanwiesel)\n- [frk1705](https://github.com/frk1705)\n",
