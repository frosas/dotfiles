  "readme": "# Auto Detect Indentation for atom\n\nAutomatically detect indentation of opened files. It looks at each opened file and sets file specific tab settings (hard/soft tabs, tab length) based on the content of the file instead of always using the editor defaults.\n\nYou might have atom configured to use 4 spaces for tabs but open a rails project which defaults to 2 spaces. Without this package, you would have to change your tabstop settings globally or risk having inconsistent lead spacing in your files.\n\n\n## TODO\n\n* Use some sort of calculation (frequency, average, gcd) to figure out the most frequent tab setting in a file (currently gets smallest tab in first 100 lines)\n* Waiting on event to listen for when a newly opened file has been parsed so we can depend on `editor.isBufferRowCommented`\n",
